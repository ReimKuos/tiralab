# Testing

## Unit testing 
    - currently both data structures are unittested
    - other functions have not been tested as they are not in their final iteration which would meke testing a waste of time

## Rightness of Output
    - Tested by listening to the output by ear, placing emphasis on these charecteristics
        - Quality: Does it sound good?
        - Originality: Does the created piece sound different enough from the training data 
        - Maby other but oet the moment just these two
    - This will be tested at a later date
