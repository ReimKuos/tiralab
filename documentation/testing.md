# Testing

## Unit testing 
    - currently both data structures are unittested
    - other functions have not been tested as they are not in their final iteration which would meke testing a waste of time

## Rightness of Output

### Methodology

 - Tested by listening to the output by ear, placing emphasis on these charecteristics
    - Quality: Does it sound good?
    - Originality: Does the created piece sound different enough from the training data
 - These charesteristics were given a grade from 1 to 10
    - For quality this means that 1 is a horrid mess that cannot be considered music, 5 is something that doesn't sound repulsive and could be considered musical and 10 is something that could be considered to be produced by an actual musician
    - For Originality 1, is a copy of a training piece, 5 has a parts of the training data (different pieces) but also has some originality, and 10 is something not closely related to the training data but can sound similar
 - These charesteristics were tested by creating 4 sets with different degrees of markov chains, with three pieces for each degree, the degrees were 2, 4, 6, and 8

### 2nd degree
 
 - Quality
    - 
 - Originality
    - They seemed to work as part chaotic part like a scale pratice for this reason the originality score is 3.5/10
 - General
    - Alltought there was some harmony the pieces themselves seemed a bit chaotic and directionless, also the first had a duration of over 24 minutes

### 4th degree

### 6th degree

### 8th degree
