# Project Specifications

## Needed algorithms and data structures

### Algorithms

 - A random number generating algorithm
 - An algorithm for converting midi- files to readable form

### Data structures

 - Matrix structure, this will store all of the propabilities

## Input

Input will be a large set of soud files (midi- files seem the most promising at the moment), which will be used as the "training" for the algorithm  

## Output

The output will be a randomly generated music

## Sources (possible, all might not be used)
